    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "Our goal is to predict the minimum number of character substitutions required to turn a given input string of alphabetical characters into an English dictionary word (into *any* English dictionary word). That is, to predict the hamming distance between a given input string and its nearest English word. This problem can be solved with brute force nearest-neighbor search, or with a BK-tree, but takes a considerable amount of time if one needs to make this prediction many times. So the purpose of this project is to be able to generate approximations of this shortest distance more quickly. The words will come from the open source WordSet dictionary, the training inputs will be generated from random strings, and the training labels will be generated using the brute force search approach. The same process is used to create the test data. We will train our model on this data and its performance will be measured by computing the average error |predicted distance - true distance| across the test dataset."

    "\n",
    "Hamming distance is the measured difference between two strings of equal lengths. As a simple example, the two strings 'car' and 'cat' would have a Hamming distance of 1, meaning that they only differ by one character. This mathematical concept was first published in 1950 his paper 'Error detecting error correcting codes' <a name = \"hamming\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#hammingnote). \n",
